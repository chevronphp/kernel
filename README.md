# chevron/kernel

So Kernel is still unstable and as much as I would like to tag a v1, I'm going
to wait--not sure how long. However, I've made some I'm-not-going-to-code-that
decisions that deserve an explanation.

For starters, the original idea is to have a handful of (decoupled) components
that when combined, would power a web site. In development, I looked over Aura
and a few other frameworks to see how they did it. In trying to write code that
was a poor man's clone of any one system I wrestled with how I wanted Kernel to
function.
